# Rent Calculator

This is a simple **Rent Calculator** built using **Python** and **Tkinter** for the GUI (Graphical User Interface). The calculator helps users compute the total rent along with additional charges like food, water, electricity, and other expenses, and divides the total cost among the number of people sharing the rent. It provides a detailed breakdown of monthly costs and the per-person cost for a specified number of months.

## Features
- Input for **monthly rent**, **food charges**, **water charges**, **electricity charges**, and other expenses.
- Input for the **number of people** sharing the rent.
- Input for the number of **months** to calculate the rent for.
- **Detailed results** showing the total monthly cost, total cost for the given months, and the per-person cost both monthly and for the entire period.
- Error handling to ensure valid inputs.
